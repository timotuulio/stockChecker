Use yarn:
  yarn add helmet

Start api:
  node app
    Use postman to try the api
start frontend:
  node node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/start.js


Done:
  The api can call for the date for highest volume and highest change in priceDate
  The api can call for longest uptrend
    Both are for the date range



Next up:
  Push everything to github
    Everything in github but the auto-lockin not working.
    Also two branches in git -,-
  Do something with react
  Do the last "answer for question C"

  Some cleaning up would be good to do before returning the code
    The api has dublicate code. I couldn't get the async fs.createReadStream working
    Maybe some comments would work miles

  The Api finds data from a file. It needs to find it from somewhere else
    Maybe parsing the data somehow, so that the values are values and not strings with $ in it

  Ask if that one stock is enough knowledge or it there should be more than that
