Use yarn:
  yarn add helmet

Start api:
  node app
    Use postman to try the api
start frontend:
  node node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/start.js


Done:
  The api can call for the date for highest volume and highest change in priceDate
  The api can call for longest uptrend
    Both are for the date range


Next up:
  Do something with react
    Reactissa ei toistaseks oo state:ja, koska meinasin hoitaa noi linkeill√§. localhost:3000/highest tjm
    Linkit toimii
  Do the last "answer for question C"

  Some cleaning up would be good to do before returning the code
    The api has dublicate code. At least the make dates out of parameters
    Maybe some comments would work miles

  The Api finds data from a file. It needs to find it from somewhere else
    Maybe parsing the data somehow, so that the values are values and not strings with $ in it

  Ask if that one stock is enough knowledge or it there should be more than that


Joku react-juttu:
  <Header wasd={"wasd"}/>,
  const [page, setPage] = useState("0")
  onClick={() => setPage("change")}
